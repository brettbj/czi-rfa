Our collaborative network includes a number of groups expected to respond to this RFA. A selected, but by no means comprehensive, set of related projects include:

* _Augmented training_ is a technique used in image analysis via the selection of arbitrary patches or the application of arbitrary rotations to avoid learning meaningless structure in data. The single cell gene expression equivalent is the bootstrap resampling of reads. Rob Patro, an expert in fast gene expression quantification, is expected to apply. We hope to work with Rob to generate augmented training examples by very rapidly resampling observed cells.
* _Model Interpretation_ is a key factor for any unsupervised approach. Elana Fertig and Loyal Goff's RFA (shared via GitHub) describes methods for the interpretation of unsupervised models. We are excited to collaborate on methods and infrastructure for model interpretation. We have previously interacted via github on related work and added features based on between-group requests.
* _Deep learning_ is expected to be relevant to other proposals. For example, Arjun Raj proposes to employ these methods for image segmentation analysis. We recently completed a large GitHub-authored collaborative review to identify deep learning strategies that address biological problems. We look forward to working with Arjun's group as they address this challenge.
* _Reproducible workflows_ will be needed to consistently apply and evaluate methods. We are happy to work with any participating groups, as well as CZI software developers, to provide and configure continuous integration servers for scientific workflows. We have not included a budget for this in our application as it would seem to make more sense as a centrally provided service; however, we can modify our plan to incorporate this if requested. Rob Patro's group has previously extended our example configurations to provide a sample workflow via continuous integration.

If you are writing a proposal that you feel is relevant to ours, please file a pull request to add a mention or let me know in some way.
