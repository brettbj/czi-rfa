Application to "Collaborative Computational Tools for the Human Cell Atlas" https://chanzuckerberg.com/initiatives/rfa

I just decided to write one of these.
I am interested in methods to define the gene expression latent space for single cells, and to connect that back to large numbers of bulk transcriptomes.
Drop a line via issues if you're interested in networking our proposals.
Please also note if you'd be interested in reviewing some text via PR.
I'd love to operate under a pull request + review model if I can find sufficient reviewers.

Thanks!
Casey
